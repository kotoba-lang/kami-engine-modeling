;; Regression: `stable-uuid` is the identity key for documents, assemblies,
;; occurrences and drawing views. Until 2026-08-20 it returned the SAME uuid
;; for every short name under ClojureScript and never agreed with the JVM for
;; any name, while this suite — which only ran on the JVM — was green. The
;; frozen values below are the JVM values, unchanged by the fix: they are
;; here so a future change to the hash cannot silently rewrite identities
;; that are already persisted.
