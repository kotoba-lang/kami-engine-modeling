  "Sheet metal: bend allowance, flat patterns, and folding back.

  A sheet metal part is a flat blank that a press brake bends. Every dimension
  on the drawing is an OUTSIDE mold-line length — where the two outside faces
  would meet if the bend were a sharp corner — and the blank is shorter than
  their sum, because material at the outside of a bend stretches and material
  at the inside compresses. The line between them, which neither stretches nor
  compresses, sits at `k-factor` of the way through the thickness.

  So the whole subject is one number and its consequences:

      bend allowance   BA = theta (R + K T)          arc length of the neutral line
      outside setback  OSSB = (R + T) tan(theta/2)   OML corner to bend tangent
      bend deduction   BD = 2 OSSB - BA              what the blank is short by
      flat length      = sum(OML) - sum(BD)

  `unfold` produces the blank; `fold` walks the neutral line back into space.
  The test that matters is not that they invert each other — two functions
  sharing a wrong formula invert perfectly — but that the folded path's ARC
  LENGTH, computed from the geometry of the arcs, equals the flat length,
  computed from the deduction formula. Those are different derivations.

  Not here: multi-directional (branching) flanges, curved bend lines, hems,
  jogs, louvres, corner relief, springback compensation, and material-specific
  K-factor tables. `unfold` refuses a part it cannot lay flat rather than
  returning a blank that would be cut wrong."
