  never agreed with the JVM for any name. `reduce` over a string gives 1-char

  "Deterministic portable FNV-1a-style identifier. Payload integrity may use

  Same defect as `stable-uuid` had, and the same fix: `reduce` over a string
  yields 1-character STRINGS in ClojureScript, so `(int ch)` was NaN, and
  `(* … 16777619)` left the exact integer range where the JVM used int32.
  The consequence was subtler than a collision — each runtime was internally
  consistent, so `valid-document?` passed on both — but a JVM host and a
  browser client computed DIFFERENT `:document/revision` values for the same
  document. Since that revision is what `projection-current?` and
  `drawing/current?` compare, and what collaboration operations are signed
  against, the two sides disagreed about whether anything was up to date.
  JVM values are canonical; CLJS was moved onto them."
